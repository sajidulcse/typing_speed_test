Object-oriented programming has a sweeping impact because it appeals at multiple levels and promises faster and cheaper development and maintenance. It follows a bottom-up approach to develop applications. The word object-oriented is the combination of two words i.e. object and oriented. The dictionary meaning of the object is an article or entity that exists in the real world. The meaning of oriented is interested in a particular kind of thing or entity. In layman's terms, it is a programming pattern that rounds around an object or entity are called object-oriented programming. The object-oriented programming is basically a computer programming design philosophy or methodology that organizes/ models software design around data, or objects rather than functions and logic. An object is referred to as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. Everything in OOP is grouped as self-sustainable objects. It is the most popular programming model among developers. It is well suited for programs that are large, complex, and actively updated or maintained. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing major concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. These core concepts support OOP. A real-world example of OOP is the automobile. It more completely illustrates the power of object-oriented design. The major concepts that we have discussed above are known as pillars of OOPs. There are four pillars on which OOP rests. 1. Abstraction, 2.Encapsulation, 3.Inheritance, 4.Polymorphism.
